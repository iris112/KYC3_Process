This Project aims to create a lightweight web application with a connected database and encrypted data storage.

ICO Maintainers can ask potential investors to signup, fillout the necessary KYC information, upload ID/Passport picture and a selfie.

In a lightweight enterprise dashboard the maintainer can run the KYC on the investors and checks for the identity.
